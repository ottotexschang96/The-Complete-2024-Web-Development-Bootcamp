    <h2>Work experience</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Battery Management System Development Intern, Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), Ningde, Fujian, China (July - Sept 2018)
            <ul>
                <li>Initiated the introduction of neural network models into the company, successfully reducing the maximum voltage error by 25x and the average voltage error by 273x for electric-vehicle battery voltage prediction. This was achieved using the backpropagation algorithm's neural network models, as opposed to the equivalent circuit model for the lithium-ion battery.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Social networking service - LINE bot, Web App, Udemy | Python, Heroku, GitHub (April 2021)
            <ul>
                <li>Established a LINE bot through official registration and initiated the development environment by creating a project on GitHub, a platform for version control and collaboration, allowing multiple people to work together.</li>
                <li>Installed necessary packages and employed example codes for functionality. Registered an account on Heroku, a cloud platform service, and set up an application case. Successfully installed Heroku CLI and deployed the programmed bot to Heroku, enabling the bot's online functionality.</li>
                <li>Configured the bot by linking the deployed URL to the LINE bot settings and began responding to received messages. Executed reply functionalities and successfully concluded interactions in accordance with programmed dialogues and user inputs.</li>
                <li>Effectively developed and deployed a responsive LINE bot by integrating technologies like GitHub and Heroku, managing bot configurations, and implementing user interaction functionalities, ensuring seamless and effective user communication.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
